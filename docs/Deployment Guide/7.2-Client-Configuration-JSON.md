A new environment will require that a client configuration json file is provisioned such that the client application knows which backend to authenticate to and to send request to.
* The value should be a valid JSON with next format:
```
{
    "tenantId": "[tenant ID]",
    "clientId": "[client AAD app id]",
    "apiScope": "api://[cdn endpoint name part]-cdne.azureedge.net/[server AAD app id]/access_as_user",
    "baseUrl": "[PFA azure function url]"
}

```
* Use this value for the config json variable on the next step.
