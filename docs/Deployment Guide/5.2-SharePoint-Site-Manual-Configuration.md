* Add all users BMCP AAD group to the site visitors group (this includes internal and GUEST users)
* Add admins BMCP AAD group to the site collection administrators
* Add users who can edit the site configuration (e.g. document templates, proxy users, etc) to the site members group (for non-admins)
* If there are users who should only have partial edit rights (e.g. can edit proxy users list, but not document templates) then the permissions hierarchy must be broken at the list level. If this occurs the read access from the site must be maintained at each list.
