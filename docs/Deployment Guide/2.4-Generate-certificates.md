Suggested approach to generating a certificate using PnP PowerShell. 
See documentation here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/new-pnpazurecertificate?view=sharepoint-ps>

Here is the script to generate a certificate:
 
```
$data = New-PnPAzureCertificate -OutPfx Cert.pfx -OutCert Cert.cer -CommonName "[Name of the certificate]" -Country "au" -Locality "vic" -ValidYears 5 -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "[your password here]" -AsPlainText -Force)
$data | ConvertTo-Json | Add-Content -Path ccertdata.json;
```

Save pfx, cer and certdata.json files and the certificate password in secure storage.
You can generate a certificate in any other way or change any values used for generation, according to your rules or policies.

Certificates to generate:
1. A certificate for **"[EnvPrefix] BMCP DevOps"** AAD App. The certificate should have 2 years lifetime. This certificate will be used for authorisation for Azure DevOps provisioning pipelines. Certificate expiration wonâ€™t affect the app, only new deployments.
1. A certificate for **"[EnvPrefix] BMCP Server"** AAD App. The certificate should have 5 or 10 years lifetime. This certificate will be used for authorisation for BMCP application. Expiration will affect the application work, it should be re-generated and updated before it expires.

As the output, you should have 2 sets of certificate files with passwords.
