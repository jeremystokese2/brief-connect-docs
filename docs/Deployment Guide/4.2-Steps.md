**Wait at least 30 minutes after creating a rule before you test it. If you test immediately after you create the rule, you may get inconsistent behaviour.**

When the rule is ready and working, make sure notifications enabled in the Azure Function App settings. Notifications should be enabled in the App Settings, as they will be filtered by the rule created above.

*DisableAllNotifications: false*
