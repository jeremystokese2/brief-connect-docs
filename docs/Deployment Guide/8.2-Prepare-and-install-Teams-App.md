* Open manifest.json file in “teams” folder from “\[ENVPREFIX] Client” code repository.
* Replace the App ID guid with a unique generated for the current environment.\
  To generate a unique App ID guid open powershell and type New-Guid
* If the app is not the production app, you may want to update the packageName, staticTabs/Name properties, name and description sections to reflect this.
* Replace `<<app domain>>` placeholder to be actual application domain url ( < CDN-ENDPOINT-NAME >.azureedge.net )
* Replace `<<sharepoint domain>>` placeholder to be the SharePoint Tenant name. For help with finding your Tenant name, see instructions [here](https://www.bing.com/search?q=azure%20find%20tenant%20name)  . E.g: [BMCPtenant.sharepoint.com](http://abctenant.sharepoint.com/) 
* Replace `<<AAD Server App ID>>` placeholder to be id of the AAD Server App
* Add app icons to the same folder with manifest file. See <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema> Icons section for more details.
* Create a ZIP package with the manifest.json, color.png, and outline.png files. The two image files are the icons for your app in Teams.
  * Name this package App.zip (for example).
  * Make sure that the 3 files are the top level of the ZIP package, with no nested folders.
* [Upload and publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps)  App.zip to your tenant's app catalog so that it is available for everyone in your tenant to install.
