BMCP is the briefing note and cabinet submission management. BMCP is based on the ABC application, originally developed by Engage Squared.

The following deployment guide details how a new **environment** is established, the use of DevOps pipelines to deploy updates, and manual tasks that are required to finalise deployment activity.

Brief resources summary for each environment:

* 1 SharePoint site collection
* 3 AAD Apps (Service principals)
* 1 Azure Resource group containing all resources.
* 1 Service accounts with Outlook license
* 1 Personal Teams app
* A set of AAD security groups following environment specific naming convention
* A set of CI/CD Pipelines in Azure DevOps

All from above should be unique for every environment, except AAD apps, which can be re-used for non-production environments. Make sure you’re using environment-specific naming rules for all the resources provisioned in this guide.

More details in related sections of this document.


**1.1 Note on naming:**
> It’s nice to have a name of the environment in all related resources. For example, if a UAT environment is deployed, then add ‘uat’ prefix or postfixes to resource groups, sites, AAD groups, AAD apps, etc. It should be combined with any naming convention rules you have.
