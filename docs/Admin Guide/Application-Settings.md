# Logo Configuration

You can configure logos in the `/appSettings` page.

To configure logos in Brief Connect, use the following specifications for the images. All images should be in `.png` format.

1. **Favicon**  
   - Size: `192x192` pixels  
   - Format: `.png`

2. **Navbar Logo**  
   - Recommended Size: `270px` wide x `96px` high  
   - Note: The app retains the original aspect ratio of the image and scales it to a height of `32px` in the navbar. Images wider than a `3:1` ratio may not display well on mobile devices.

3. **Primary Icon (Used in PDF Pack)**  
   - Max Width: `250px`  
   - Max Height: `95px`  
   - Note: The icon will scale to fit within these dimensions. 

These dimensions ensure optimal display across the application while maintaining aspect ratios and responsiveness.
