##What is a proxy?

A Proxy actions tasks on behalf of a related role/person. Proxies have the same access and permissions as their related role/person and will receive a copy of their notifications. 

###Who should use a Proxy?

Proxies will commonly be used by Ministers, however all staff are able to use this feature to facilitate flexible working, such as job-sharing arrangements. 
It’s important that anyone requesting a proxy understands that proxies can act on their behalf and have access to all records they have access to.

- Once a proxy is allocated their end date can be amended or they can be completely removed through “manage proxy settings” under the settings cog.

- Roles can have more than one Proxy, and proxies can have more than one related role.
