The ‘initiator’ is the person who creates a new record in ABC then sends the record to other people for action.

Records are initiated from within a user's dashboard screen by selecting the ![image.png](.attachments/image-6f12a5d9-8527-4cee-80f8-43c96401a213.png) button.

Upon selecting new record button, the initiator will be required to follow several steps to create their record. Although there are different record types that can be created by the initiator, the steps and data fields presented to the initiator will remain similar across different record types and sub types. 

Some tips for navigating initiating a record are:
- When initiating a document all mandatory fields and all relevant optional fields need to be completed.
- Mandatory fields are marked with *
- When moving though the initiation process users can select next or back to move through stages and make amendments.
- If all mandatory fields are not completed, the next button will remain greyed out.
- Once all mandatory fields are completed, the next button will turn blue.
- There will be different field types.
- Some dropdown fields only allow the selection of one item whereas others enable multiple options.
- When tick boxes are visible in drop down fields, this means multiple options can be selected.
