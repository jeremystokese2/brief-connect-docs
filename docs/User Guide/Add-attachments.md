Users can attach documents both during record creation and when modifying existing records.

There are three categories to which users can attach documents:

- Attachments
- Primary Documentation
- Supporting Documentation.

To upload documents when creating a new record, users must go to the step 'Add templates and documents', scroll down to the appropriate section, press the 'Select file' dropdown, and choose whether to select a file from their drive or SharePoint Online.
